# NEURO120_Final_patrykwekwejt
This project consists of seven key MATLAB script files:
- classify_cells_pat, which classifies DMS neurons based on waveform and firing statistics;
- format_waveforms_pat_based_on_lab_code, which formats and preprocesses waveform data to match lab-standard conventions;
- kmeans_clustering, which performs unsupervised clustering of neurons based on extracted features;
- normalization_for_warped, which normalizes neural activity traces for temporally warped trials;
- plot_behavioral_events, which visualizes behavioral event timestamps across trials;
- warped_z_score, which computes z-scored neural activity across temporally aligned trial segments;
- warped_z_score_per_cell_type, which applies z-scoring to neural activity traces separately for each classified cell type.

Data is currently stored on my hard drive and because of the size constraints it is not uploaded in any other accessible formats. I am of course ready to share it anytime on request!
